.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm sqlbox
library is a secure database access library at this time limited to
sqlite3 databases.
Instead of operating databases in-process,
.Nm
uses a multi-process, resource-separated approach to safe-guard the
database from the calling application.
It is most effective on
.Ox
when used with
.Xr pledge 2 .
.Pp
The typical usage scenario is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
allocate a context with
.Xr sqlbox_alloc 3 ,
.It
open a database connection in that context with
.Xr sqlbox_open 3 ,
.It
execute statements with
.Xr sqlbox_prepare_bind 3
or
.Xr sqlbox_exec 3 ,
.It
explicitly close databases with
.Xr sqlbox_close 3 ,
.It
free the context with
.Xr sqlbox_free 3 .
.El
.Pp
There's also support for transactions
.Xr sqlbox_trans_immediate 3
and
.Xr sqlbox_trans_commit 3 ,
which should be used instead of manually specifying SQL transactions to
prevent nested requests.
.Pp
The current version of
.Nm
is defined in
.Dv SQLBOX_VERSION
as a string of major number, minor number, and build.
These values are available seperately as
.Dv SQLBOX_VMAJOR ,
.Dv SQLBOX_VMINOR ,
and
.Dv SQLBOX_VBUILD ,
respectively.
A numeric concatenation of the version is defined as
.Dv SQLBOX_VSTAMP ,
which may be used to test for version number applicability.
.Ss Compiling
Applications should use
.Xr pkg-config 1
to configure compiler and linker flags.
Compiling
.Nm
applications typically looks as follows, assuming
.Pa main.c
is the source file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% cc `pkg-config --cflags sqlbox` main.c `pkg-config --libs sqlbox`
.Ed
.Ss Pledge Promises
The
.Nm
library is built to operate with applications that use
.Xr pledge 2
on
.Ox
to limit file-system access.
This protects the database from direct tampering and forces the
application to use the socket channel for communication.
.Pp
Prior to calling
.Xr sqlbox_alloc 3 ,
the application may pledge with
.Va stdio rpath cpath wpath flock proc fattr
and only
.Va stdio
afterward.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct sqlbox *p;
struct sqlbox_cfg cfg;
struct sqlbox_src srcs[] = {
  { .fname = (char *)":memory:",
    .mode = SQLBOX_SRC_RWC }
};

if (pledge("stdio rpath cpath "
    "wpath flock proc fattr", NULL) == -1)
  err(EXIT_FAILURE, "pledge");

memset(&cfg, 0, sizeof(struct sqlbox_cfg));
cfg.msg.func_short = warnx;
cfg.srcs.srcs = srcs;
cfg.srcs.srcsz = 1;

if ((p = sqlbox_alloc(&cfg)) == NULL)
  errx(EXIT_FAILURE, "sqlbox_alloc");

if (pledge("stdio", NULL) == -1)
  err(EXIT_FAILURE, "pledge");

/* Do work. */

sqlbox_free(p);
